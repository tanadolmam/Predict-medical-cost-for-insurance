# Predict-medical-cost-for-insurance
This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the medical cost of insurance for patients. 
The dataset used is obtained from Kaggle.
The EDA is performed to understand the correlation between the features and the target variable. 
Various regression models from scikit-learn library are utilized and the performance of the models is evaluated through statistical metrics.  
The final model is chosen by GridSearchCV to optimize the hyperparameters. 
<br>This project can be a great reference for anyone interested in using machine learning for cost prediction in the healthcare industry.
